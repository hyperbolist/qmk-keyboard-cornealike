# Corne-alike

This firmware is based on [Elrgo S](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/elrgo_s), uses the default [Corne keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/default) with some GUI functions lifted from [Noah Frederick](https://github.com/noahfrederick/qmk-keymaps), and [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods).

It's for a hand-wired keyboard with 42 keys in a 3d printed [Corne case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3652379) with [revised keyplates](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4609755), 2 pro micros, and no OLEDs or underglow or anything fancy.
